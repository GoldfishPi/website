Hi, I'm Erik Badger.  

I am a full stack engineer based in Minnesota. I work at [Tickr](https://www.tickr.com)! I'm passionate about programming, and problem solving.

In my free time, I enjoy running, hiking, or enjoying the outdoors.

You can find me and all my projects on [Github](https://github.com/GoldfishPi).
