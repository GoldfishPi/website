# Hi, I'm Erik Badger.  

I'm a JavaScript Engineer from Minnesota ❄️ in love with react and typescript. I currently work on data visualization at [Tickr](https://tickr.com).

I maintain an open source react ui library [Lassie Bug](https://github.com/lassiebug/lassiebug-ui).

When I'm not coding you can find me running, hiking, and enjoying the outdoors.
