            This is the UI library I developed for my own personal projects and currently being used on this site.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is written in React and designed to be completely modular so I can pull in small pieces into any project I am working in.

        <p>
            This was a project I built to keep track of the places I worked while I was on road.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project has become become mix between a travel blog and a web app and uses Vue and Nuxt to accomplish this.

    <Card
        header={() => <h4>Melodist.js</h4>}
        footer={() => (
            <div>
                <a href="https://github.com/GoldfishPi/melodist.js">Github</a>

        <p>
            This is a fork of the front end framework we use at Tickr <a href="http://lyonbros.github.io/composer.js/">Composer</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The porpose of this fork was to introduce concepts like a functional component system and add xdom utilities while maintaining support for backbone like data structures such as models and collections.
        </p>
        <p>
            Would I ever use it over a modern framework? No absolutely not! But it's really fun to mess around with these "lower level" concepts we take for granted in our modern tools

        <p>
            Linux is an extremely customizable desktop system because of this my desktop has taken on a fairly unique look and every once and a while someone will ask how I made it look this way. This is how! A bunch of configuration files that I'm always tweaking.
        </p>

        footer={() => (

            These are the scripts I use to manage my system and general productivity.
